      Pakistan is currently experiencing two trends; a youth bulge without
      productivity, and increasing digitization of the economy and society. The
      trends are anticipated to continue and accelerate in the years to come.
      The digitization of the economy has extensive potential to promote youth
      employment in the country. The COVID-19 pandemic shock reinforced the
      importance of digital skills for youth to have decent work opportunities.
      As Pakistan currently has the youngest population in its history (65
      percent of the total population is below the age of 30 while 29 percent is
      between the ages of 15 and 29 years) but a majority of them lack relevant
      and advanced skills to fulfil the demands of global markets. At the same
      time, the country has the largest number of freelancers, making it the top
      five countries in the world for providing freelancing services using
      digital mediums. It is obvious that digital skills can generate job
      opportunities for youth. In fact, the provision of digital skills to youth
      is more than a necessity than a choice. National Rural Support Programme
      (NRSP) in collaboration with Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF) is
      playing its role and commitment to supporting digital skills for youth
      from underprivileged backgrounds in Pakistan. It is implementing the
      project ‘Revitalizing Youth Enterprise (RYE) through digital and life
      skills training’ funded by and part of the Citi Foundation flagship
      program ‘Pathways to Progress’ a job skills-building initiative that
      addresses the persistent, global issue of youth unemployment. The project
      has supported 200 poor young boys and girls from underdeveloped areas of
      four cities districts including Karachi, Sukkur, Bahawalpur, and Multan,
      in developing relevant digital skills through a 3-month training in
      e-commerce, digital marketing, social media management, graphic designing,
      and life skills. Here I present the success stories of two beneficiaries;
      Mr Muhammad Sheeraz Saeed is from Hasilpur, Punjab. After graduating from
      the Government College of Technology in Hasilpur, with a degree in civil
      engineering in 2019, he could not find a job. But an online learning
      training program has given him two “gifts”: digital and life skills.
      Sheeraz was one of two hundred young boys and girls from underprivileged
      backgrounds who took part in three months long ‘Revitalizing Youth
      Enterprise (RYE) through digital and life skills training’. He was trained
      in digital marketing because he sees the significance of such skills in
      job markets. He said that the skills he acquired from the digital skills
      training project have made him more productive and relevant in the job
      market. “When I saw this opportunity on Facebook, I jumped at it and
      applied. I never in my life would I have thought that I will have such an
      opportunity. For the first time in my life, I feel confident in myself. I
      can now work from the comfort of my home in the digital field without
      wasting time and money on transportation”. After completing the training
      in Canva. Facebook, website development, and e-commerce, he made business
      accounts and gigs on Facebook, Instagram, and Fiverr. He is now looking
      for clients on these platforms. For Sheeraz this is just one great step
      for his empowerment to become part of digital means of earning. He is
      confident about his success. He was also trained in life skills imperative
      for dealing with clients and achievement of his plans. Ms Zoofa Sajid is
      from Chak 143 Murad in Punjab. She has been in search of employment for a
      long time after graduation in commerce. Continuous rejections and sitting
      without work at home have disappointed her but she has never lost hope.
      She had found a job but was paid very less that was barely even enough for
      her transportation. She had heard about online earning but never gathered
      the confidence to step up due to a lack of reliable knowledge, guidance,
      and skills. She got to know about ‘Revitalizing Youth Enterprise (RYE)
      through digital and life skills training’ through her village community
      organization which provided information and guidance about the training
      opportunity. When she was selected for the social media management and
      life skills course she was over the moon. “It is an era of social media
      and digital marketing; such skills are required to remain relevant in the
      job market. I got three months of training on how to make, design, and
      edit social media posts and videos on canva, and how to get online work,
      especially on Fiverr.” She had success with finding an international
      client who paid him in dollars. She thinks online work suits girls and
      women in Pakistan. “I made my social media accounts and started earning
      during training. I developed ads and started a self-promotion campaign and
      found a client from the United States of America. I ran a campaign on
      Facebook for him and he got good results, he paid me $75 and since then I
      am working and trying to find more such opportunities. In the beginning,
      it was tough because I have never worked in such a way but when I
      understood the process then I am enjoying it. I believe freelancing and
      online earning are best for girls. Boys can go and work anywhere without
      any hurdle but there are a lot of sociocultural issues for girls working
      outside of their homes. They can easily earn while sitting in their
      homes.” She is on a mission to inspire girls of her village to acquire
      digital skills to make themselves productive. “I share my experiences with
      girls in my village and motivate them to digital skills to make themselves
      productive and have decent work.
